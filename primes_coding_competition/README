1. You must write a function that will take two ints as input, and return true if both
numbers are A) Primes and B) exactly two away from each other

2. You must write a function that will return true if a number is a perfect
number, which means its factors, summed up, equal the number. For example, 6
is a perfect number because its factors are 1,2,3, and 1+2+3 is 6. 8 is not a
perfect number because its factors are 1,2,4, and 1+2+4 is 7, not 8. So it
would return true for 6, but false for 8.

Notes: negative numbers cannot be primes or perfect numbers. If they type in
something not an integer print "BAD INPUT!" to the screen and exit.
