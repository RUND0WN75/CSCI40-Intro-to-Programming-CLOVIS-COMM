For this program you will take a bunch of number input by the user and sort
them from greatest to smallest.

There are two sections marked YOU where you should write code.

First, you need to write a function which will pick out the maximum element of
an array. This function is up top above main. It will return the maximum
element found, and will return the index number of it in the index_no
parameter that is passed by reference.

Second, you will need to write a sorting algorithm using either bubble sort or
selection sort. (Don't use code copied from Stack Overflow because I know how
to Google, too.)

Basically, what the sorting code will do is this:
1) It creates a new array called sorted_array of the same size as the original
array. 
2) For each spot in sorted array, it will pick out the maximum element from
the original array, and then remove that element from the original array.

This will result in the sorted array holding all the elements from the
original array, but in sorted order, and the original array being effectively
destroyed.

Don't mess with any of the input or output code, as it is all fully
functional. ONLY write code where it says "YOU:"
