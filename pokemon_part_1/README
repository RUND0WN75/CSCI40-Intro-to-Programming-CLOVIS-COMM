You teach me and I'll teach you - Pokémon!

This should be a fun greenfield assignment
that will teach you from the ground up how
to make classes, read from files, store
data in vectors, and use it to do something
quite interesting and cool.

This is Part 1 of a two part assignment.

For Part 1 you will need to:

=====================================================================================

1) Write a class for a Pokémon, that at a minimum holds its index number,
name, hp, attack, defense, speed, special, and type1 and type2. These member
variables will all be ints except name, type1 and type2, which are strings
instead.

In case you're curious, a description of what each field means follows:
A. The index number can be used by the user to specify what number Pokémon they want.
B. The name is used to describe the Pokémon, such as "Pikachu"
C. HP is how much damage it can take before it dies. Sorry... "faints, and is
sent to the Pokémon farm upstate".
D. The attack value is multiplied to all damage this Pokémon does. For
example, if a Pokémon would normally do 20 damage with an attack, if it had an
attack of 10 it would do 200 damage.
E. The defense value is divided into all damage this Pokémon receives. For
example, if a Pokémon would normally take 200 damage from an attack, a Pokémon
with a defense of 10 would take 20 damage. (Attack and defense thus balance
out.)
F. Speed is used to determine which Pokémon gets to attack first in a round.
If they are tied, flip a coin to see who attacks first.
G. Special works like both attack and defense, but only for attacks marked as
"special" attacks.
H. Type1 and type2 hold the type(s) of the Pokémon, which is something like
"Fire" or "Dragon". Some Pokémon have two types, some only have one. If it has
only one type, type2 should be "". Note this is held in a separate file
(types.txt)

In Part 2 you'll be using these numbers to fight the Pokémon!

=====================================================================================

2) You must write a class for moves, which is to say all possible moves that a
Pokémon can do in the game. It must contain all of the following at a minimum:
index, name, type, category, PP, power and accuracy. Name, type, and category
are strings, the others are all integers. What they mean:

A. Index is the index number that can be used by the user to select a move
(like "move 20", which is bind)

B. Name is the name of the move (like "Hyper Beam")

C. Type indicates what sort of damage it does, like Fire or Ice. Normal is the normal damage type.

D. Category is either "Physical" which means it uses the normal attack and
defense stats, or "Special" which means it uses the special stat instead.
There are also "Status" attacks, which you should delete when you see them

E. PP is how many times a move can be used in combat before the Pokémon must
switch to another move.

F. Power is how much damage an attack does by default.  This is multiplied by
the attacker's attack stat and divided by the defender's defense stat.

G. Accuracy is the chance the attack will hit.

Any weird lines (like with a - instead of a number) should discard the entire
move.

=====================================================================================

3) You must load the data from the files into a vector of your classes to hold
all Pokémon and moves known to mankind (as of Generation I).
 
 You will load from "pokemon.txt" and "moves.txt".

 When loading from a moves file, discard any lines that include an emdash: —
 That's not a normal hyphen, so copy and paste it from this file into your
 code, if you want to do something like this: if (c == '—')

 Likewise, discard any lines that say "status" from the moves file.

=====================================================================================

4) You must then print out all the files loaded. If the user skipped loading a
file, don't print anything out for it. You'll print them out AFTER all the
files are loaded to demonstrate you loaded them into the vectors successfully.

Here is a snippet from the middle of the Pokedex that will show you what the
format should look like:
Pokedex Entry 75: Graveler hp: 55 attack: 95 defense: 115 speed: 35 special: 45 type1: Rock type2: Ground
Pokedex Entry 76: Golem hp: 80 attack: 110 defense: 130 speed: 45 special: 55 type1: Rock type2: Ground
Pokedex Entry 77: Ponyta hp: 50 attack: 85 defense: 55 speed: 90 special: 65 type1: Fire type2:
Pokedex Entry 78: Rapidash hp: 65 attack: 100 defense: 70 speed: 105 special: 80 type1: Fire type2:

Here is a snippet from near the end of the movedex showing the format:
Move Index 132: Constrict  type: Normal category: Physical PP: 35 power: 10 accuracy: 100%
Move Index 136: High Jump Kick  type: Fighting category: Physical PP: 10 power: 130 accuracy: 90%
Move Index 138: Dream Eater  type: Psychic category: Special PP: 15 power: 100 accuracy: 100%
Move Index 140: Barrage  type: Normal category: Physical PP: 20 power: 15 accuracy: 85%

Note the missing index numbers - they were thrown out for being status moves
or having an emdash in them.

=====================================================================================

Discussion:

Parsing files is a skill in its own right, and since I'm giving you text files
literally copy-pasted from a website, you'll get some real-life experience
parsing.

There's three ways we usually read data in C++ (c is a char, s is a string):
1) One letter at a time (cin >> c)
2) One word at a time (cin >> s, or getline(ins,s,'\t') for tab-delimited
files)
3) One line at a time (getline(cin,s))

When reading from files, replace cin with the name of the variable you made to
read from the file, such as pokemon_file, for example to read a word from a
file: pokemon_file >> s

=====================================================================================

Stringstreams!

We can also read from a string like it is cin, by using something called a
stringstream. We use it all the time when parsing files to make life easy.
getline(pokemon_file,s); //Reads an entire line from the file into s
stringstream sts(s); //Turns s into a stringstream named sts
sts >> s2; //Reads the first word out into a string s2
if (isdigit(s2.at(0))) //Test to see if the first letter is an int
int attack = stoi(s2); //Convert it to a number if it's a number

This allows you to do things like count how many words are on a line without
breaking everything, which is useful since some of the moves have two or three
words in them. Consider the following code:
	string line;
	getline(ins, line); //Read a line from the file ins
	stringstream sts(line); //Turn the line into a stringstream
	vector<string> words;
	while (sts) {
		string s;
		sts >> s;
		if (ss) words.push_back(s);
	}
	//After this loop finishes, we have a vector of strings containing all 
	// of the words on this line, this lets us do things like this:
	if (words.size() < 7 || words.size() > 9) continue;
